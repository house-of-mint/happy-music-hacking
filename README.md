Programming with an esoteric programming language [ORCA](https://github.com/hundredrabbits/Orca),
as MIDI event generator, resulting in a programmatic approach to music :)

AND IT'S FUN!!! :D:D:D

Happy hacking!

## ORCA overview

ORCA is an esoteric programming language as stated by the inventors [hundredrabbits](http://100r.co).

Basically it's all about generating events, so called bangs.
These take place within a certain frame and can generate MIDI or other events, like UDP Messages.
Due to this design, ORCA can be used for many things like programming music or visual components.

As a part of house of mints art project this will be a big part, since the structure and shire amounts
of possibilities allow unlimited creativity (Once one got started). ORCA works in a free space,
unlike programming laguages usually do.

For the first session see **22-12-2019-Techno** where we created a few patterns that nicly illustrate
how ORCA works.


## Working with ORCA

In order to make music with ORCA, one needs to have some sort of sound source, that can work with the
generated MIDI/UDP events. For getting started I recommend using [Pilot](https://github.com/hundredrabbits/pilot),
but there are several other companion applications:

- [Estra](https://github.com/kyleaedwards/estra), a companion sampler tool.
- [Gull](https://github.com/qleonetti/gull), a companion sampler, slicer and synth tool.
- [Sonic Pi](https://in-thread.sonic-pi.net/t/using-orca-to-control-sonic-pi-with-osc/2381/), a livecoding environment.

If you have worked with Ableton live before, this is a very powerfull (but also expensive (very expensive)) option.
Only recommanded if you'r really ambitious about this kind of stuff.
